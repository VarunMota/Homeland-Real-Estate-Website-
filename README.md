# Real-Estate-Management-Using-Php
The real estate industry plays a crucial role in our lives, as it encompasses the place we call home and the spaces where we conduct our businesses. With the rapid advancement of technology, there is a growing need for online platforms that facilitate property searches, making it easier for customers to find their ideal properties.

Hence, we created Homeland website. It is a groundbreaking website that caters to this need, offering a user-friendly and comprehensive solution for property rentals and purchases. This website is created using HTML, CSS and PHP. Homeland has reduced the time and effort required to find suitable properties, benefiting both customers and real estate professionals. The website's emphasis on transparency and security has also contributed to building trust among customers and enhancing the overall credibility of the real estate market.

1.2 Problem Definition

The existing property search process is plagued by inefficiencies, limitations, and a lack of transparency, leading to a frustrating experience for customers. Traditional methods often result in wasted time and effort as customers struggle to find suitable properties that meet their specific preferences. Limited access to comprehensive property listings and a lack of detailed information further exacerbate the problem, causing customers to miss out on potential opportunities. 

Moreover, the lack of trust and transparency in the real estate market adds to the challenges, hindering customer confidence and inhibiting the smooth functioning of the industry. Customers experience frustration and dissatisfaction, which may discourage their active participation in the real estate market. Missed opportunities arise as customers are unable to access comprehensive listings or obtain accurate and detailed property information, leading to potential loss of ideal properties which impacts both customers and company stakeholders.

1.3 Objective of Project

The primary objective of Homeland is to provide customers with a hassle-free experience when searching for properties. Some of the other objectives are:
•	To provide advanced search features that allow customers to filter properties based  on specific criteria such as price, size, amenities, location, and more. This helps 
customers narrow down their search and find properties that align with their preferences and budget.
•	To offer a comprehensive database of property listings, ensuring that customers have access to a wide range of options in their desired location
•	To foster transparency and security in the real estate market by verifying and validating property listings.
•	Allowing experienced real estate professionals who are available to answer queries, provide advice, and offer personalized recommendations based on customer’s needs and preferences.


1.4 Scope of Project

The scope of Homeland includes a wide range of property types (residential, commercial, industrial), geographic coverage, rental and purchase properties, comprehensive listings, advanced search functionality, detailed property information. However, currently the website does not provide support to contact with the customers digitally by the admin. The requested customers need to contacted using traditional methods by the admin currently. Also the admin cannot update property details of already registered properties on the site, they can only add properties to the site or delete from the site.
